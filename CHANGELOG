* Fixed a gem packaging problem (circular dependency)
  There was a packaging problem with Kaminari 0.11.0 that the gem depends on
  Kaminari gem. Maybe Jeweler + "gemspec" method didn't work well...

== 0.11.0

This release contains several backward incompatibilities on template API.
You probably need to update your existing templates if you're already using
your own custom theme.

* Merge _current_page, _first_page_link, _last_page_link and _page_link into
one _page partial #28 [GarthSnyder]

== 0.9.13

  This means, Kaminari is now *ORM agnostic*  ☇3☇3☇3

== 0.9.12

* Moved the whole pagination logic to the paginator partial so that users can
touch it
  Note: You need to update your _paginator.html.* if you've already customized
  it. If you haven't overridden _paginator.html.* files, then probably
  there're nothing you have to do.
  See this commit for the example:
    https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari_themes/commit/2dfb41c

== 0.9.10

* the per() method accepts String, zero and minus value now #7 [koic]
  This enables you to do something like this:
	Model.page(params[:page]).per(params[:per])

* Added support for Gem Testers (http://gem-testers.org/) #8 [joealba]

== 0.9.9

* :params option for the helper [yomukaku_memo]

  Example:
  = paginate @users, :params => {:controller => 'users', :action => 'index2'}

  [:previous, :next, :truncate] are externalized to the I18n resource.

  https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari_themes

== 0.9.6

in a declarative way
  Example:
  class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
    paginates_per 10
  end

== 0.9.5

* works on AR 3.0.0 and 3.0.1 now #4 [danillos]

== 0.9.4

* introduced module based tags
  As a side effect of this internal change, I have to confess that this
  version brings you a slight backward incompatibility on template API.
  If you're using custom templates, be sure to update your existing templates.
  To catch up the new API, you need to update %w[next_url prev_url page_url]
  local variables to simple 'url' like this.
    https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari/commit/da88729

== 0.9.3

* improved template detection logic
  When a template for a tag could not be found in the app/views/kaminari/
  directory, it searches the tag's ancestor template files before falling back
  to engine's default template. This may help keeping your custom templates DRY.
