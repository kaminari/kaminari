## 0.11.0

This release contains several backward incompatibilities on template API. You probably need to update your existing templates if you're already using your own custom theme.

* Merge `_current_page`, `_first_page_link`, `_last_page_link` and `_page_link` into one `_page` partial #28 [@GarthSnyder]

## 0.10.3

* Fixed a bug that `total_count()` didn't work when chained with `group()` scope #21 [@jgeiger]

* Fixed a bug that the paginate helper didn't work properly with an Ajax call #23 [@hjuskewycz]


## 0.10.2

* Added `:param_name` option to the pagination helper #10 [@ivanvr]

   ```haml
   = paginate @users, :param_name => :pagina
   ```


## 0.10.1

* Fixed a bug that the whole `<nav>` section was not rendered in some cases [@GarthSnyder]


## 0.10.0

* Railtie initializer name is "kaminari" from now

* Changed bundler settings to work both on 1.9.2 and 1.8.7 #12 [@l15n]

* Fixed bugs encountered when running specs on Ruby 1.9.2 #12 [@l15n]

## 0.9.13

* Added Mongoid support #5 [@juno, @hibariya]

  This means, Kaminari is now *ORM agnostic*  ☇3☇3☇3


## 0.9.12

* Moved the whole pagination logic to the paginator partial so that users can touch it

  Note: You need to update your `_paginator.html.*` if you've already customized it.
  If you haven't overridden `_paginator.html.*` files, then probably there're nothing you have to do.
  See this commit for the example: https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari_themes/commit/2dfb41c

## 0.9.10

* the `per()` method accepts String, zero and minus value now #7 [@koic]

  This enables you to do something like this:
  ```ruby
	Model.page(params[:page]).per(params[:per])
  ```

* Added support for Gem Testers (http://gem-testers.org/) #8 [@joealba]


## 0.9.9

* `:params` option for the helper [@yomukaku_memo]

  You can override each link's `url_for` option by this option
  ```haml
  = paginate @users, :params => {:controller => 'users', :action => 'index2'}
  ```

* refactor tags


## 0.9.8

* I18n for the partials `:previous`, `:next`, and `:truncate` are externalized to the I18n resource.


## 0.9.7

* moved template themes to another repo https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari_themes


## 0.9.6

* added `paginates_per` method for setting default `per_page` value for each model in a declarative way

  ```ruby
  class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
    paginates_per 10
  end
  ```


## 0.9.5

* works on AR 3.0.0 and 3.0.1 now #4 [@danillos]


## 0.9.4

* introduced module based tags

  As a side effect of this internal change, I have to confess that this version brings you a slight backward incompatibility on template API.
  If you're using custom templates, be sure to update your existing templates. To catch up the new API, you need to update %w[next_url prev_url page_url] local variables to simple 'url' like this.  https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari/commit/da88729


## 0.9.3

* improved template detection logic

  When a template for a tag could not be found in the app/views/kaminari/ directory, it searches the tag's ancestor template files before falling back to engine's default template. This may help keeping your custom templates DRY.

* simplified bundled template themes


## 0.9.2

* stop adding extra LF between templates when joining

* githubish template theme [@maztomo]


## 0.9.1

* googlish template theme [@maztomo]

* show no contents when the current page is the only page (in other words, `num_pages == 1`) #2 [@hsbt]


## 0.8.0

* using HTML5 `<nav>` tag rather than `<div>` for the container tag


## 0.7.0

* Ajaxified paginator templates


## 0.6.0

* Hamlized paginator templates


## 0.5.0

* reset `content_for :kaminari_paginator_tags` before rendering #1 [@hsbt]


## 0.4.0

* partialize the outer div


## 0.3.0

* suppress logging when rendering each partial


## 0.2.0

* default `PER_PAGE` to 25 [@hsbt]


## 0.1.0

* First release
